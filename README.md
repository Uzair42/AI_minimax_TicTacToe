## 🧮 Algorithm Details

### 1️⃣ 2-Player Mode Logic

- Standard TicTacToe 3x3 board logic.
- Each move is validated before being played.
- Winner determined by:
  - 3 rows
  - 3 columns
  - 2 diagonals
- After each game round, scoreboard updates automatically.
- Turn indicator changes color:
  - 🟣 Player 1 - Purple
  - 🔵 Player 2 - Blue

### 2️⃣ AI Mode Logic

| Difficulty | Algorithm Used | Behavior |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Easy | Random Move | Makes purely random moves. User can easily win. |
| Medium | Block & Win Strategy | Blocks opponent win and tries to win itself, but doesn't plan ahead. |
| Hard | **Minimax Algorithm** | Fully recursive search of all game states; perfect AI that can't lose. |

#### 🔎 Minimax Algorithm:

- Fully explore all possible game trees.
- Assign scores (+10, -10, 0) for Win, Lose, Draw.
- Use recursion to backtrack and choose the optimal move.
- Implemented with depth to speed up performance.

## 🧰 Architecture & Approach

- ✅ **Kotlin Android with XML layouts**
- ✅ **Activities** for navigation.
- ✅ **FragmentContainerView** for mode selection.
- ✅ **Separation of UI & Logic**
- ✅ **Board is a 2D Char Array**
- ✅ **Game engine fully testable and isolated**
- ✅ **Animations using Android XML Animations**
- ✅ **Reusable Score & UI Logic**
